# DB_Optimizer

In real world situations, creating database projects is more just making a scheme that fits the description. We are usually faced with a lot of questions like <br>
• What DBMS should we use? <br>
• Is it better to make it relational or NOSQL? <br>
• How to get the best performance <br>
• What Hardware spec. are recommended to use? <br>
• ...etc 

In this project we try to <br>
• Understand the concepts of database tuning. <br>
• Get through the phases of database tuning. <br>
• Use different database tuning techniques <br>
• Optimizing the schema • Optimizing the memory requirements <br>
• Optimizing queries. <br>
• Use different database optimization tools. <br>
• Practice Using NoSQL DataBases <br>
• Perform analysis between using SQL & NOSQL Databases. <br>
• And answer the above questions
